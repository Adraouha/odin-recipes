<h2>Description</h2>

</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
      <li>2 cups whole milk</li> 
      <li>/4 cup white vinegar</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups flour</li>
      <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened, or as needed, for greasing, plus more for serving</li>
      <li>toppings of choice, e.g. maple syrup or fruit, for serving
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Step 1</li>
    <p>SPreheat a griddle to 300 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    <li>Step 2</li>
    <p>Stir together milk and vinegar in a small bowl or a 4-cup liquid measuring cup.</p>
    <li>Step 3</li>
    <p>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a second bowl.</p>
    <li>Step 4</li>
    <p>Beat eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add vanilla and milk mixture; whisk together. Add flour mixture to bowl with egg mixture and whisk until just combined. (Batter will be lumpy.) Let rest 3 minutes and gently stir again.</p>
    <li>Step 5</li>
    <p>Melt some butter on the griddle, then carefully wipe with a paper towel. (You want just a bit of a sheen; donâ€™t overgrease the griddle.) Spoon batter in 1/3-cup portions onto griddle. Cook until bubbles form on surface of batter, about 2 1/2 minutes.</p>
<li>Step 6</li>
<p>MFlip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 1/2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately with butter and toppings.</p>
